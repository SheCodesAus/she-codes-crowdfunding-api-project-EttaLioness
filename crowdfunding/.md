## What is ResearchMob?
ResearchMob is a crowdfunding platform enabling the community, industry and academia to contribute funding towards innovative scientific research.
Funds are directly distributed to the scientists conducting the research project, unlike receiving grands at a University where generally only 85-50% of total funds are received. 


## Target Audience
Open to the community and organisations that are interested in research and science that would otherwise have no access or ability to fund a scientific project. Contributors also have the choice to be acknowledged in the publication, thereby having a direct scientific impact that is shared with the world.

Scientists of all fields have the opportunity to receive funding where they may not be eligible or unable to be funded by a University or grant program. Thus, removing barriers and enabling scientific innovation and our world to excel.
